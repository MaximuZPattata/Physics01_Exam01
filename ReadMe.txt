<<--------------------------------------------------------------------Nucleonic Particles Attack---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

About - Spaceship goes through asteroid belt. Everytime an asteroid hits the spaceship, an explosion is created(displayed by red sphere in the simulation). Post explosion, the part of the ship that exploded willhave a black mold created on it.

How to build - The solution "NucleonicParticlesAttack.sln" needs to be built(either in Debug or Release). The project "AsteroidAttack" should be set as startup project. Now the project can be run. 

Controls - There are Camera controls for the user.
	 - W,A,S,D,Q,E for camera movement
	 - Ctrl + W,A,S,D,Q,E for camera rotation
	 - 1,2,3,4,5 for different hardcoded angles of the spaceship
	 - Spacebar to deflect closeby asteroids
